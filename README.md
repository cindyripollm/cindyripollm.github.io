### Career Portfolio  

This repository acts as a visual presentation of my previous works developed during my undergraduate career at the University of Miami. The goal of this project is creating an interactive storage focused on the presentation of my present career and its gradual development. To a degree, it aims to act as a personal website, similar to a Wikipedia sight (except, I alone have the administrative capability of editing or modifying the code).

I graduated from the University of Miami with a Bachelor of Arts and Sciences degree: I specialized in Psychology and Spanish with minors in Philosophy and Ecosystem's Science and Policy. Thus, research investigations may be displayed in Spanish or English. Additionally, all publications will fall within the realm of the aforementioned fields.
