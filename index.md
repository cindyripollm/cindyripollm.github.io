This GitHub Page acts as a visual presentation of my previous work, and simultaneous achievements and milestones, accomplished throughout my career as a University of Miami student in the School of Arts and Sciences. Additionally, independent papers and more recent works acquired on my journey toward a doctoral degree in Clinical Psychology, will be accessible. Given my specializations in Psychology and Spanish, with miniors in Philosophy and Ecosystem's Science and Policy, all publications made on this cite, will fall within these areas of interest. The goal of this project is to create an almost interactive archive of my gradual career development: to a degree, it acts as a personal website, similar to a Wikipedia sight. Enjoy!
