This GitHub Page acts as a visual presentation of my previous work, and simultaneous achievements and milestones, accomplished throughout my career as a University of Miami student in the School of Arts and Sciences.  Given my specializations in Psychology and Spanish, with miniors in Philosophy and Ecosystem's Science and Policy, publications will fall within these areas of interest and may be in Spanish or in English. Nonetheless, the goal of this project is to create an almost interactive archive of my gradual career development: to an extent, it acts as a personal website, similar to a Wikipedia page.
